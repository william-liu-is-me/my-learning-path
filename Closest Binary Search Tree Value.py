'''idea of this code:
learn the idea of the code below online, but i dont think that is very simple and
clear. so I made some updates.

1. I use try except to capture the TypeError when these is no instance below nodes.
this also means that the num I am looking for doesnt exist in the tree.

2. I create a dict to store the differece of k and the node. 
the difference is the key, the node is the value.
later on I can just min() the dict.keys() to find the smallest different, and then
find the value(which is the node)

however, there is one issue in this code: if there are 2 nodes the same difference
to K, the code can only return 1 node. as the dict wil replace the value if key exist.
